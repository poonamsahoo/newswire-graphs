# newswire-graphs
A graph analysis of the Dell Research Newswire Dataset, specifically focused on characterizing newspaper similarities and behaviors. 

Our code is split up into four folders:
- **DATA** contains notebooks for aggregating data from the original newswire dataset, webscraping ground truths from Dave Leip's Atlas of US Presidential Elections, and pushing our resulting datasets to huggingface.
